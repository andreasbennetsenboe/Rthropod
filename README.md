# touRdemols

<!-- badges: start -->

The package touRdemols is a collection of functions that can be used to
efficiently calculate and display the standings in a Tour de Mols
competition. The competion is a central part of the Arthropod Field
Course for first year undergraduate students at Aarhus University, but
can probably be applied anywhere in the world for any larger taxon.

## Installation

You can install the released version of touRdemols from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("andreasbennetsenboe/touRdemols")
```

## Example

The folder ‘exampledata’ contains seven data sets from teams that
competed in the Tour de Mols. We use these here to illustrate.

``` r
#library(touRdemols)
## basic example code
```
